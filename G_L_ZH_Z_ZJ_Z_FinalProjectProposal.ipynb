    "Face recognization plays an increasingly important role in our daily life. It covers a variety of usage from social media to traditional industries. Facebook auto tag or cell phone facial unlock and even remotely open a bank account. A recent survey showed that 72% of hotel operators are expected to deploy facial recognition by 2025 to identify and interact with guests. In addition to some survey, By 2024, the global facial recognition market could generate $7 billion in revenue. As we can see, facial recognition will become a common and useful technology."

Also, the image contains other information that we can use as data to do analysis. In our project, we plan to use a series of images to recognize/predict different people by race or gender. We will change the image information into the data firstly. Then use these data to analyze and construct models. Finally, select a preferred one and get our conclusion."
